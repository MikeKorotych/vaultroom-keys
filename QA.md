# QA record

## Automated checks

Run from the repository root:

```bash
pnpm lint
pnpm typecheck
pnpm test
pnpm build
```

The API suite covers name sanitisation, invalid uploads, room rename, room object cleanup, permissioned-share validation, folder cascade deletion and share ownership. The web package runs a strict TypeScript check in the test step. Both applications also build from a clean production command.

## Production smoke test

Checked against <https://vaultroom-ruby.vercel.app> and the Railway API:

- web document returns HTTP 200;
- API health route returns HTTP 200;
- owner routes without a Clerk token return HTTP 401;
- an unknown share hits PostgreSQL and returns the expected HTTP 404 response;
- Railway reports a successful deployment after `prisma db push`;
- Playwright loads the production page with the expected title and no console errors.

## Authenticated acceptance path

1. Sign in and create a blank room or load the prepared Northstar room.
2. Open each folder and preview a generated PDF.
3. Drag a PDF onto another folder, then drag it onto the room breadcrumb.
4. Rename the PDF and verify the audit event in Review → Activity.
5. Create a public room link, open it in a private browser and navigate into a nested folder.
6. Create an email-restricted folder link and verify that another email cannot open it.
7. Revoke both links in Review → Access and verify that they return 404.
8. Rename the room in Review → Room.
9. Delete a disposable room and verify that it disappears from the rail.

The public beta currently uses Clerk development keys. This keeps the hosted demo free, but it also imposes Clerk's development limits and displays its development-mode notice. A production release must use a verified domain, production OAuth credentials and production Clerk keys.
